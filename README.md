## User Story
Bob hates writing tests for his code. He gets bored doing it. One day, he decided that since his code worked fine in his development branch, he could push it to production without testing it. He broke his app! Bad Bob! Now, Bob using BAT to test his code before pushing it live. Yay Bob!
