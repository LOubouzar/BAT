# BAT
## Browser-based Automated Testing

## About 
BAT is an automated testing tool for developers by developers! Link your github repo and we will unit and integration test your code using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). 

## User Story
Bob hates writing tests for his code. He finds it boring and tedious. One day, he decided that since his code worked fine in his development branch, he could push it to production without testing it. Alas, he broke his app! Bad Bob! Now, Bob is using BAT to test his code before pushing it live. Yay Bob!
